## WebSocket Protocol

View the websocket details on [Grapevine][websocket-docs].

## Server

### Requirements

This is only required to run Grapevine itself, the server. These are not required to connect as a game. See the above [websocket docs][websocket-docs] for connecting as a client.

- PostgreSQL 10
- Elixir 1.8.0
- Erlang 21.2.6
- node.js 10.13.0

### Setup

```bash
mix deps.get
mix compile
cd assets && npm install -g yarn && yarn install && cd ..
mix ecto.reset
mix phx.server
```

This will start a web server on port 4100. You can now load [http://localhost:4100/](http://localhost:4100/) to view the application.

### Running Tests

```bash
MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.create
MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.migrate
mix test
```

### Docker

```bash
docker-compose build grapevine
docker-compose up -d postgres
docker-compose run --rm grapevine migrate
docker-compose up grapevine
```

### Telnet Web Client

Telnet connections live in the `apps/telnet` application. This node holds the telnet connections so the main application can reboot on deploys and not drop active game connections.

For deployment the telnet application needs to be on its own erlang node. You can connect with something similar to:

```elixir
config :grapevine,
  topologies: [
    local: [
      strategy: Cluster.Strategy.Epmd,
      config: [
        hosts: [
          :grapevine@localhost,
          :telnet@localhost,
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
```

## Setting up a new Play CNAME

- Game sets the CNAME to `grapevine.haus`
- Game must have a homepage url
- Game must have the web client enabled
- Update game's record for their CNAME
- Update nginx config for new domain
- Run certbot for the new domain
- Refresh CNAMEs in ETS `Grapevine.CNAMEs.reload()`
